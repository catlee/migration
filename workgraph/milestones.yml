windows-testing-tier2:
    title: "Windows testing running in TC at tier 2"
    milestone: true
    due: 2016-12-15
    description: |
        Dustin totally made this date and set of dependencies up.
    dependencies:
        - windows-tests-win7-tier2
        - windows-tests-win10-tier2

linux-android-nightlies-tier2:
    title: "Linux32/64 and android nightlies at tier2"
    milestone: true
    due: 2016-11-01
    description: |
        Nightlies for the linux32, linux64, and Android platforms are
        implemented on a project branch, and produce updates that can be
        dogfooded by team members.
    dependencies:
        - linux32-nightlies-tier2
        - linux64-nightlies-tier2
        - android-nightlies-tier2

linux-android-tier1:
    title: "Linux32/64 and android at tier1"
    milestone: true
    due: 2017-01-01
    description: |
        All builds and tests for the linux32, linux64, and Android platforms
        are running in TaskCluster at tier 1, with Buildbot jobs demoted or
        disabled. All tasks are scheduled via TaskCluster, but hardware-only
        tasks are executed via BBB.  Since tier-1 opt builds are what we ship
        to users, this also requires nightlies and preparations for making full
        releases when they are due.
    dependencies:
        - linux32-opt-tier1
        - linux64-opt-tier1
        - android-opt-tier1

no-buildbot-schedulers:
    title: "Buildbot schedulers are disabled (except ESR)"
    milestone: true
    description: |
        The Buildbot scheduler masters are no longer scheduling any jobs except
        ESR builds.
    dependencies:
        - stop-bb-schedulers

all-releases:
    title: "Everything has been released at least once from TC (except ESR)"
    milestone: true
    description: |
        We have performed a final release for all platforms, built and tested
        on all TaskCluster.
    dependencies:
        - android-release
        - linux32-release
        - linux64-release
        - macosx-release
        - windows-release

almost-no-buildbot:
    title: "Turn off Buildbot except for ESR and Thunderbird"
    milestone: true
    description: |
        Buildbot is almost completely unused -- with the exception of ESR and
        Thunderbird, which we just have to wait for.  The Buildbot
        infrastructure is drastically scaled back and left to run until it is
        no longer used.
    dependencies:
        - all-releases
        - stop-bb-schedulers
        - stop-bb-build-masters
        - stop-bb-test-masters
        - stop-bbb

no-buildbot:
    title: "Buildbot completely turned off"
    milestone: true
    description: |
        All Buildbot infrastructure is unused and decomissioned.
    dependencies:
        - almost-no-buildbot
        - thunderbird-off-bb
        - esr-on-bb-desupported
